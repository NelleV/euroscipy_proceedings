The conference
--------------

The 8th edition of the European Conference on Python in Science, EuroSciPy was
held for the second time in the beautiful city of Cambridge, UK from August,
26th to 29th, 2014. More than 200 participants, both from academia and
industry, attended the conference.

As usual, the conference kicked off with two days of tutorials, divided into
an introductory and an advanced track. The introductory track, presented by
Joris Vankerschaver, Valerio Maggio Joris Van den Bossche, Stijn Van Hoey and
Nicolas Rougier, gave a quick but thorough overview of the SciPy stack, while
the experience track focused on different advanced topics. This second track
began with an introduction to Bokeh, by Bryan Van den Ven, followed by an
image processing tutorial with scikit-image by Emmanuelle Gouillart and Juan
Nunez-Iglesias. The afternoon continued with two tutorials on data analysis:
the first, intitulated "How “good” is your model, and how can you make it
better?" (by Chih-Chun Chen, Dimitry Foures, Elena Chatzimichali, Giuseppe
Vettigli) focused on the challenges face while attempting model selections,
and the first day concluded with a statistics in python tutorial by Gael
Varoquaux. During the second day, the attendees tackled an in depth 4 hour
tutorial on Cython, presented by Stefan Behnel, and a crash course on
"Evidence-Based Teaching: What We Know and How to Use It", by Greg Wilson.

Tiziano Zito and Nicolas Rougier co-chaired the Program Committee, to design
and organize the talks and poster track. The main track consisted of keynote
talks, contributed talks, the very famous lightning talks, and last but not
least the poster sessions. The first keynote given by Pieter Hintjens
presented his mind opening, challenging, and somewhat provocative thoughts on
challenges faced while building open source communites, taking examples in his
experience while leading the widely used zeromq project.

The second keynote, delivered by Randy Leveque, focused on the use of Jupyter
notebooks for teaching, documentation, and reproducible research Talks and
posters presented new tools and research in various scientific fields
(physics, bioinformatics, machine learning, applied mathematics, etc.).

The conference closed with coding sprints where participants could contribute to
scientific tools, including the general interest package SciPy but also
specialized projects such as scikit-learn and scikit-image.

Acknowledgments
---------------

As EuroSciPy grows bigger, the need for hard work and dedication from
volunteers grows as well. This year, Enthought provided significant
administrative, financial and organizational support to the conference.  We
thank our sponsors, Enthought, Nanopore, the MET office, the Python Academy,
Komodo IDE, O'reilly, PACKT publishing, Numfocus and most of all the
University of Cambridge, our host for this 8th edition.

These proceedings are the result of many hours of work by
authors and reviewers alike. We thank them for their significant
investment in these manuscripts.
Acknowledgments also go to [arXiv]_ for hosting the proceedings and for
providing an open platform for scientific publishing.
