The conference
--------------

The 7th edition of the European Conference on Python in Science, EuroSciPy was
held from the 27th to the 30th of August 2014 in Cambridge, UK. The conference
was attended by more than 200 participants, both from academia and industry.

The conference kicked off with two days of tutorials, divided into a
introductory and an advanced track. The introductory track, presented by Mark
Dickinson, David Cournapeau, Ralf Gommers and Phil Elson, gave a quick but
thorough overview of the SciPy stack. In the mean time, experienced users
discovered the new features of IPython 2.0 (by Cyrille Rossant) and scikit-image
(by Stéfan van der Walt), learned advanced profiling features (Yury Zaytsev),
and deepened their knowledge of machine learning and performance computing, with
a four hour tutorial on scikit-learn and pandas (Gaël Varoquaux and Olivier
Grisel), followed by a tutorial by Elias Freider on Luigi, a tool that enables
spotify to process huge amounts of data, and finally a high performance
computing tutorial (Ian Ozsvald).

After four long years as Program chair, Tiziano Zito stepped down this year
and passed on the torch to Ralf Gommers to design and organized the main
track. The main track consisted of keynote talks, contributed talks, the very
famous lightning talks, and last but not least the poster sessions. The first
keynote was given by Steven G. Johnson, on *Crossing barriers with Julia, Scipy
and Ipython*. The second keynote was delivered by Ben Nuttall, on the use of
Python in Science Education. Talks and posters presented new tools and
research in various scientific fields (physics, bioinformatics, machine
learning, applied mathematics, etc.).

The conference closed with coding sprints where participants could contribute to
scientific tools, including the general interest package SciPy but also
specialized such as scikit-learn and scikit-image.

The proceedings
----------------

After last year's success, the proceedings are back for a second year. This
year, we focused on improving the reviewing pipeline both in terms of
efficiency and quality. A total of 12 papers were submitted, covering a large
number of fields: Bioinformatics, Neuroscience, Geology, Astrophysics, etc.
Each paper was reviewed by at least two members of the proceeding committee
openly on Github. The committee consisted of members from several countries,
both from industry and academia. The reviews and papers, as well as the tool
used to produce this document are publicly available on
http://github.com/euroscipy/euroscipy_proceedings.git

Similarly to the proceedings of EuroSciPy 2013 [EuroSciPy2013]_, this edition is
published on the [arXiv]_ preprint server under the Creative Commons Attribution

This means that they are published without financial impact on the conference
and in the open spirit that is encouraged within the Python community, as they
will be available without restriction.

Acknowledgments
---------------

As EuroSciPy grows bigger, the need for hard work and dedication from volunteers
grows as well. This year, Enthought provided significant administrative,
financial and organizational support to the conference.  We thank our sponsors,
Enthought, AHL, Python Academy, GitHub, The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) and
our partners Logilab, G-Node, O'Reilly, Python Software Verband e.V, and most of
all the University of Cambridge that hosted this 7th edition.

These proceedings are the result of many hours of work by
authors and reviewers alike. We thank them for their significant
investment in these manuscripts.
