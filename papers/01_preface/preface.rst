The conference
--------------

The 7th edition of the European Conference on Python in Science, EuroSciPy was
held from the 27th to the 30th of August 2014 in Cambridge, UK. The conference
was attended by more than 200 participants, both from academia and industry.

The conference kicked off with two days of tutorials, divided into a
introductory and an advanced track. The introductory track, presented by Mark
Dickinson, David Cournapeau, Ralf Gommers and Phil Elson, gave a quick but
thorough overview of the SciPy stack. In the mean time, experienced users
discovered the new features of IPython 2.0 (by Cyrille Rossant) and
scikit-image (by Stéfan van der Walt), learned advanced profiling features
(Yury Zaystev), and deepened their knowledge of machine learning and
performance computing, with a four hour tutorial on scikit-learn and pandas
(Gael Varoquaux and Olivier Grisel), followed by a tutorial on Luigi, a tool
that enables spotify to process huge amounts of data, and finally a high
performance computing tutorial (Ian Oswald).

After four long years as Program chair, Tiziano Zito stepped down this year
and passed on the torch to Ralf Gommers to design and organized the main
track. The main track consisted of keynote talks, contributed talks, the very
famous lightning talks, and last but not least the poster sessions. The first
keynote was given by Steven Johnson, on "Crossing barriers with Julia, Scipy
and Ipython". The second keynote was delivered by Ben Nutall, on the use of
Python in Science Education. Talks and posters presented new tools and
research in various scientific fields (physics, bioinformatics, machine
learning, applied mathematics. etc).

The conference closed with code sprints around many scientific tools. It led
to improvement in projects such as scipy, scikit-learn and scikit-image.

The proceedings
----------------
After last year's success, the proceedings are back for a second year. This
year, we focused on improving the reviewing pipeline both in terms of
efficiency and quality. A total of 12 papers were submitted, covering a large
number of fields: Bioinformatics, Neuroscience, Geology, Astrophysics, etc.
Each paper was reviewed by at least two members of the proceeding committee
openly on Github. The committee consisted of members from several countries,
both from industry and academia. The reviews and papers, as well as the tool
used to produce this document are publicly available on
http://github.com/euroscipy/euroscipy_proceedings.git


Similarly to the proceedings of EuroSciPy 2013 [EuroSciPy2013]_, this edition is
published on the [arXiv]_ preprint server.

Acknowledgments
---------------

As EuroScipy grows bigger, the need for hard work and dedication from
volunteers grows as well. This year, Enthought provided significant
administrative, financial and organizational support to the conference.
We thank our sponsors, Enthought, AHL, Python Academy, Github, Nag and our
partners logilab, g-node, o'reilly, and python verband, and most of all, the
university of Cambridge, that welcomed us for this 7th edition.

These proceedings are the result of many hours of work by
authors and reviewers alike. We thank them for their significant
investment in these manuscripts.
